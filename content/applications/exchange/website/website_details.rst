In this section, all the necessary items for an exchange site are explained.
Usually, the exchange website provides its customers with free exchange rate information and tools such as currency conversion calculator, historical rates and charts, and monthly average exchange rates. We give you this information in the form of odoo snippet. Each of these pieces is described below.
There is a tutorial on how to use snippet in this `link <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/applications/websites/website/web_design/building_blocks.html>`_.
